                    <h3>Awin Affiliate Program</h3>
                    <p>We participate in the Awin affiliate program, which uses tracking cookies to monitor when you click an affiliate link and make a purchase. This tracking allows us to receive commissions for qualifying purchases.</p>

                    <h4>How Affiliate Tracking Works</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>When you click on an affiliate link, a tracking cookie is placed on your device</li>
                        <li>This cookie tracks your visit to the service provider's website</li>
                        <li>If you make a purchase, the tracking system attributes the sale to our affiliate link</li>
                        <li>We receive a commission for qualifying purchases</li>
                        <li><strong>Important:</strong> Affiliate tracking does not affect the price you pay</li>
